# Microservice-JWT-Auth
My first motivation to build this Microservice was to help the Junior Enterprise CITi to automize it's process of development work. For that, I've builded this Node.js application with Expres.js micro-framework to assembly the server, and structured the Core of this Microservice with the *jsonwebtoken* module of Node.
<br>
<br>
This applications works following theses next steps:
<br>
1- Recive some JWT by the Bearer Token request.
<br>
2 - Run the script looking for incompatibilities, like the different secrets used to encrypt the same variable.
<br>
3 - And finilly, returns the data of the JWT.
<br>
<br>
With that, you're abble to construct different ways to work with this response in the frontend. To help you a little bit with theses ways, I created a simple sample to return True if the JWT is valid, or return False wether the JWT is invalid. This sample is in the client folder located in the root of the project.
